# network_science_project
Network science course project

In this project we scraped data from Twitter in order to try to understand the emotional effect of Covid in China and in the US by using network analysis tools.
Apart from the analysis of the networks itself through classical measures, we tried to capture the generative process behind word clouds in the two countries by using generative latent space graph models (AME models in particular). Under the assumption that the fitted model is statistically accurate, this kind of models are able to give probabilistic informations about the confidence of some classical measures (e.g. centralities) and have also the advantage of having interpretable latent space variables.
